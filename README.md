# Mirpurkhas-Doctors-Android-App
This Android app aims to bridge the gap between doctors and patients in Mirpurkhas district, providing a digital platform for easy communication and appointment management.
## Development
Developed in Android Studio using Java and XML, following the Agile development cycle. 
## Features

- Doctor-Patient Connection
- Appointment Management
- Easy Communication

## Challenges

- Verification of doctor's identification through PMDC number (awaiting API access)
- Easypaisa payment gateway integration (in progress)

## Status

Development paused temporarily due to above challenges. Additionally:
- Database implementation pending, awaiting alternative solution for doctor verification
- History screen incomplete, considering elimination of in-app payment feature due to low average financial status of Mirpurkhas district

## GUI Clarification

Please note that the GUI may appear basic, but this was a deliberate design choice. Our instructor emphasized the need for an extremely simple and intuitive interface, as the target audience in Mirpurkhas district has limited tech adaptability. We prioritized ease of use and simplicity to ensure that the app is accessible to everyone.

## Future Plans

- Resume development with alternative database concept
- Re-evaluate features and functionality
